## App Build Instructions:

- Build a simple Ruby on Rails application that interfaces with an API to show information to the user.  You can use any API you wish to (this GitHub repository lists quite a few public APIâ€™s that you can use for free: https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis ).

- Include some form of user input, whether it be a user specified category, search term, etc. (just some sort of input from the user that alters the output).
